# IMSA Report

## About
IMSA Report was made as an easy tool to view past grade data for classes at IMSA. It is not an official site.

## Data
Two separate sets of data were attained. The first is from a 2017 FOIA request as explained on the about page. The second came from the Office of Institutional Research at IMSA.

## Raw Data
